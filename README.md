This repository is a recipe that will walk you through using [Meta Llama 3.1 405B](https://aka.ms/c/learn-deploy-llama) deployed on [Azure AI](https://aka.ms/c/learn-ai) to generate a synthetic dataset using [UC Berkeley's Gorilla](https://aka.ms/ucb-gorilla) project RAFT method (see [blog post](https://aka.ms/raft-blog)). The synthetically generated dataset will be used to finetune a selection of student models. Finally, we will deploy the fine-tuned model and evaluate its performance compared to a baseline model.

**Project Goal**: The primary objective of this project is to simplify and automate the process of distilling large language models. The workflows and notebooks are meant to be as hands-free as possible, ensuring that even complex tasks like generating synthetic datasets, fine-tuning models, and deploying them can be accomplished with minimal manual intervention. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an expert, our focus is on providing a seamless experience that allows you to focus on the results rather than the process.

## Getting started / Provisioning Azure AI infrastructure

The infrastructure for this project is fully provisioned using the Azure Developer CLI ([AZD](https://aka.ms/c/learn/azd)). AZD simplifies the deployment process by automating the setup of all required Azure resources, ensuring that you can get started with minimal configuration. This approach allows you to focus on the core aspects of model distillation and fine-tuning, while AZD handles the complexities of cloud resource management behind the scenes. By leveraging AZD, the project maintains a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier to collaborate and scale.

The easiest is to open the project in Codespaces (or in VS Code Dev Container locally). It comes with azd included.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/raft-distillation-recipe)

Login using azd

```
azd auth login --use-device-code
```

Provision the infrastructure

```
azd up
```

The post provisioning [tests.sh](./infra/azd/hooks/tests.sh) script will run infra integration tests to make sure everything is deployed successfully.

Another post provisioning script, [export_env.sh](./infra/azd/hooks/export_env.sh) will export the environment variables for the provisioned infrastructure to the generated [./.env.state](./.env.state) file.

### Bring you own models

The easiest is to provision the infrastructure using azd but you can of course also bring your own models. Just provide environment variables for endpoints of your models in the [./.env](./.env) manual env file at the root of the project.

<details>
<summary>Environment variable configuration</summary>

Those environment variables are expected by RAFT cli scripts. They are suffixed by the purpose of the model `COMPLETION`, `EMBEDDING`, `BASELINE` followed by either standard **OpenAI** or **Azure OpenAI** variable names.

Choose for each model purpose either one of the following API styles:

| Notebook      | Explanation      |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| [1_gen.ipynb](./1_gen.ipynb) | Generate a finetuning dataset using RAFT |

## Dormant infrastructure costs

While not used, the infrastructure of this project won't cost much but will still cost a bit.

**TODO**: provide costs estimations for dormant infra

## Configuration files

| File      | Explanation      |
| ------------- | ---------------- |

## Parameterized execution

In addition to executing notebooks interactively, the notebooks also support parameterized command line execution using [papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/).

### Parameter files

The parameter files are contained in folder [parameters](./parameters/) and support the following configurations:

| Parameter file     | Model      | Format      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| [Llama-2-7b.yaml](./parameters/Llama-2-7b.yaml)   | Llama-2-7b | Completion |
| [Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.yaml](./parameters/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.yaml)   | Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct | Chat |
| [Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.yaml](./parameters/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.yaml)   | Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | Chat |

### Running notebooks from the command line with a parameter file

Notebooks can be run all at once with a given parameter file using the following command:

```
./run_all.sh -p ./parameters/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.yaml
```

## Taking down the infrastructure

After you are done working with the project, you can take down the infrastructure with the following command.

**IMPORTANT**: Please be aware that this will **DELETE** everything related to this project including **generated datasets** and **fine-tuned models**.

**IMPORTANT**: Save everything important to you before running this command.

```
azd down --purge
```

**Note**: The `--purge` parameter is important to reclaim quotas, for example for Azure OpenAI embedding models.
